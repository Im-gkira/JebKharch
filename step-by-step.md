### Functionality

The Expense Tracker microservice will allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete expenses. Each expense will have the following fields:

- `id`: Unique identifier for the expense
- `description`: Description of the expense
- `amount`: Amount of the expense
- `date`: Date of the expense
- `category`: Category of the expense

### API Endpoints

The microservice will support the following API endpoints:

- `POST /expenses`: Create a new expense
- `GET /expenses`: Retrieve a list of all expenses
- `GET /expenses/{id}`: Retrieve a single expense by ID
- `PUT /expenses/{id}`: Update an existing expense by ID
- `DELETE /expenses/{id}`: Delete an existing expense by ID


1. Define the basic structure of your Expense Tracker API, including the endpoints you need and the HTTP methods used to interact with them.
2. Implement the functionality for each endpoint, such as interacting with a database or performing some other action.
3. Follow best practices for API design, including using appropriate HTTP status codes, error handling, and security measures.
4. Consider implementing features like pagination or filtering to improve client usability.
5. Use Flask Blueprints to organize your application into modular components.
6. Implement input validation to ensure data integrity.
7. Use version control, such as Git, to track changes to your code over time.
